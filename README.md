## Description

At MadChef we believe in the utmost importance of not wasting avaliable ingredients that one might have in their fridge/cupboard, and to use them efficently to make a new dish for dinner! Keeping this in mind, we created a search function where you can list in ingredients you want to use for cooking, and get back a recipe to follow for your chosen ingredients. Additionally, you can also search for many recipes by name, and get a list of dishes you can make at home! 

## Usage and Installation

You can use the heroku link on the top of this file to access this app. If you choose to run it locally or to have the source code for modifications, you will need to install MongoDB and set it up as this is the database of choice for this application. Without it, the backend/server side will not run. Once you have Mongo installed and set up, start by cloning the repository into your local machine with the following command (it will be ran in the command link applicaation of your choice):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:sikandersultan/MadChef.git
```

Open the application into your IDE of choice and install the required dependencies, and once installation is complete, use the command listed below:

```
$ npm i
$ npm run develop
```

This should start the react build, spin up the server and open the application on localhost.
